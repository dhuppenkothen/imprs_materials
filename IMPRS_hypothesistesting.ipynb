    "\n",
    "Is this significant? Well, that depends both on the conventions of your field, and the context of your problem. In many medical analyses and social sciences, the significance threshold is set at $0.05$. In this case, the result would be considered significant and the null hypothesis (\"the two samples have the same mean\") would be rejected. In astronomy and particle physics, scientists tend to express significance in terms of \"sigma\", i.e. how much of the distribution is outside the boundaries set by $x$ standard deviations. For example, particle physics uses $5\\sigma$ as a significance threshold, corresponding to a p-value of $0.00000573303$, whereas astronomers often use $3\\sigma$, corresponding to a p-value $0.002699796$. But this is only convention! There is fundamentally no absolutely correct way to specify a significance threshold: the decision depends on your tolerance for making mistakes when using this to make decisions. There are two ways you could make mistakes: (1) you could be rejecting the null hypothesis it is true, or (2) you could be accepting the null hypothesis when in fact it is not true. How tolerant you are to either of these depends on your specific problem. For example, if your null hypothesis is \"Person A does not have cancer\", then you might wish to err on the side of rejecting it a few times more often (on the basis that someone having undetected cancer would be much worse than incorrectly diagnosing someone with cancer when they don't have it.\n",
    "\n",

    "In many cases, it is hard to assure that those conditions are fulfilled.\n",
    "There are several ways to assess whether these are true. One way is to look at plots of the data (for example histograms) for an intuitive assessment. There are also statistical tests to assess for example normality (you can run a Shapiro-Wilk test that the data is normally distributed) and equal variance (for example [Bartlett's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartlett%27s_test)). Note also that [Welch's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test) is insensitive to different variances of the two samples. As above, all of these tests have their own assumptions associated with them, so be careful with conclusions drawn from them, too.\n",

    "No. Frequentist inference does not assign probabilities to hypotheses, just statistics. What we have computed is the probability of finding a value of the test statistic $T$ as large or larger than the observed value if the datasets come from two normal distributions with equal mean and variance. This is a slightly philosophical term, but important. The test statistic is, in this sense, a proxy for the hypothesis we are interested in. However, we can never attach probabilities to the hypotheses of interest directly (here $H_0=$\"The data sets come from Gaussians with the same mean\" and $H_1=$\"The data sets come from Gaussians with different means\"). \n",

    "If any of the assumptions do not actually apply to the data, then the test statistic will not be well-defined with respect to the hypothesis to be tested. We can no longer guarantee that the test statistic will behave in the way it does if the assumptions are true. For example, the distribution comparing against (here a Student t-distribution) may no longer be known (leading to incorrect p-values). \n",

Test this by simulating more data points (either from distributions with the same mean or distributions with different means). How many data points do you need to find a $3\\sigma$ p-value that they are different?\n",

    "Let's simulate the case where the two stellar populations have (slightly) different metallicities. We're going to simulate from two normal distributions with slightly different means ($0.95$ and $1.05$) and the same variance ($0.05$).

    "Note how the distribution is uniform! That is, even when we *know* the null hypothesis is true, there will be a fraction of data sets that produce small p-values *purely by chance*. But remember that this is by design: a significance threshold of $0.05$ only means that if the null hypothesis is true, then 5% of the time we will reject it purely by chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This also explains why the plot of p-value versus number of samples is not monotonous: sometimes, the p-value for small samples under the null hypothesis might be small, or conversely, sometimes the p-value of small samples if the null hypothesis is false might be large. \n",

    "Note that while not much larger, the likelihood of the two-parameter model is larger than the likelihood of the model with a single parameter. This is always true: more parameters will always give you a larger likelihood, because a model with more parameters can always fit the data better, since it is more flexible (but you might end up *overfitting* you data!). This means that the likelihood by itself is not a great tool to use for model comparison. \n",

    "So far, we have not actually done anything Bayesian. For that, we'll need to define priors. We are going to be boring and define normal priors for our problem. Our assumption that the stellar clusters are somewhere in the solar neighbourhood imply that we know the metallicities can't be too dissimilar from those of the sun. So we're going to use a normally distributed prior with a mean of $\\mu_p=1$ and a standard deviation of $\\sigma_p = 0.05$. These parameters are also called *hyperparameters*. In some cases, you can try to infer those, too, as part of your model. But we're not going to do that here.\n",
